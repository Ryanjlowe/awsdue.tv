      <description>Your account must have the ability to create new IAM roles and scope other IAM permissions.
 If you already have an AWS account, and have IAM Administrator access, you can skip this page.
  If you don&amp;rsquo;t already have an AWS account with Administrator access: create one now
 Once you have an AWS account, ensure you are following the remaining workshop steps as an IAM user with administrator access to the AWS account: Create a new IAM user to use for the workshop</description>

      <description>AWS Cloud9 is a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) that lets you write, run, and debug your code with just a browser. It includes a code editor, debugger, and terminal. Cloud9 comes prepackaged with essential tools for popular programming languages, including JavaScript, Python, PHP, and more, so you don&amp;rsquo;t need to install files or configure your development machine to start new projects.
The Cloud9 workspace should be built by an IAM user with Administrator privileges, not the root account user.</description>

      <description>Our Goal In this workshop, we&amp;rsquo;ll build an app with features including:
   The Architecture Here&amp;rsquo;s a map of the services we&amp;rsquo;ll use and how they&amp;rsquo;ll all connect.
Our Tools If we were to try and build scalable and highly-available systems to handle each of the above concerns on our own, we&amp;rsquo;d probably never get around to building our app! Fortunately, AWS provides services and tooling to handle a lot of the undifferentiated heavy lifting involved in building modern, robust applications.</description>
