A segment is a group of your customers that share certain attributes. For example, a segment might contain all of your customers who use version 2.0 of your app on an Android device, or all customers who live in the city of Los Angeles.

<!-- 
To learn more about segments, visit [Amazon Pinpoint Segments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/userguide/segments.html) in the Amazon Pinpoint User Guide.

## Create a Segment

1. Click here to download [the sample csv](/csv/activeSegment.csv). 
2. Modify the CSV to update the `Address` column to reflect email addresses you configured in the [Configure Email section ](/getting-started/configure-email/). For the following workshops you will need at least two verified email addresses for userid1 and userid2.
