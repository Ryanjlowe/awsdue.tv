The **Account-level settings** let you configure the default SMS message type for your project, account spending limits, and dedicated sender ID. 

The **Advanced configurations** let you set up a dedicated number that is assigned to your account. This is needed if you want to use two-way SMS messaging.

Click the **Save** button. You are ready to send SMS and voice messages.
