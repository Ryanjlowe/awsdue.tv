In the menu bar on the left hand side click on **Test Messaging** and select the **Email** channel.

1. Select the **sender email address** that you have verified during the project setup.

1. Enter a verified address as the recipient. This could be the same as your sender address, or additional email identities that you have verified. Amazon Pinpoint supports wildcard local parts. If you verified `fred@domain`, then `fred+foo@domain` will also work.

1. Enter a **subject line** and write a simple **message body** or accept the default. Optionally create a version of the message for recipients whose email clients only accept **plain text** emails.

1. Click the **Send message** button.

1. Now check your inbox as you should have mail.
