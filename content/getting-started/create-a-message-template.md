Design consistent messages and reuse content more effectively by creating and using message templates. A message template contains content and settings that you want to reuse in messages that you send for any of your Amazon Pinpoint projects. You can use message templates in email messages, push notifications, SMS messages, and voice messages.

Now you'll define a number of message templates that you'll refer to in the next chapter of the workshop.

### Adding Personalized Content to Message Templates

You can add message variables to a new template when you create the template, or to an existing template. If you add variables to an existing template, Amazon Pinpoint doesn't apply the changes to any existing messages that use the previous version of the template. This includes messages that haven't been sent yet, such as campaign messages that are scheduled to be sent at a later time. This means that your changes won't affect any existing messages that use the template.
