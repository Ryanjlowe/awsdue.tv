### Our Goal
In this workshop, we'll build an app with features including:

* 

### The Architecture

Here's a map of the services we'll use and how they'll all connect.

### Our Tools

If we were to try and build scalable and highly-available systems to handle each of the above concerns on our own, we'd probably never get around to building our app! Fortunately, AWS provides services and tooling to handle a lot of the undifferentiated heavy lifting involved in building modern, robust applications. We'll use a number of these services and tools in our solution, including:

* The [AWS Amplify CLI](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-cli), to rapidly provision and configure our cloud services

* The [AWS Amplify JavaScript library](https://aws-amplify.github.io/), to connect our front end to cloud resources

* [Amazon Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/), to handle user sign up authorization

* [Amazon Simple Storage Service](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) (S3), to store and serve as many photos as our users care to upload, and to host the static assets for our app

* [Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/), to provide millisecond response times to API queries for album and photo data

* [AWS AppSync](https://aws.amazon.com/appsync/), to host a GraphQL API for our front end

* [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), to create photo thumbnails asynchronously in the cloud

* [Amazon Rekognition](https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/), to detect relevant labels for uploaded photos

* [Amazon Elasticsearch Service](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/), to index and search our photos by their labels

If any or all of these services are new to you, don't worry. We'll cover everything you need to know to get started using everything mentioned above. And there's no better way to learn than to build, so let's get started!
