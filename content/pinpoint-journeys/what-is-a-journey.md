A journey is a customized, multi-step engagement experience. When you create a journey, you start by choosing a segment that defines which customers will participate in the journey. After that, you add the activities that customers pass through on their journeys. Activities can include sending messages or splitting customers into groups based on their behaviors.

In the next chapter of our workshop, you will build two journeys to guide your customers to achieve a desired result. You will also learn about the different types of activities you can use in Amazon Pinpoint.
