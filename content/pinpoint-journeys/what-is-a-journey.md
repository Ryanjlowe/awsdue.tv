A journey is a customized, multi-step engagement experience. To create a journey, start by choosing a segment that defines which customers will participate in the journey. Then add the activities that customers pass through on their journeys. Activities can include sending messages or splitting customers into groups based on their behaviors.

Build two journeys to guide your customers through activities to achieve a desired result, and learn about different types of journey activities you can create in Amazon Pinpoint.
