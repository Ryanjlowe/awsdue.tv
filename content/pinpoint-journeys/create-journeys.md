In this section of the workshop we are going to build an advanced journey. In order to do this section you **MUST** complete the previous Amazon Pinpoint [Getting Started](/getting-started/) section as we will be using a number of these components.

We are going to replicate a real life onboarding flow where we try to either "Re-engage" inactive users (see right hand red side of the diagram) by a sequence of emails or alternatively if the user is active on our site (see left hand side) we send a flow to get them to perform tasks which creates stickiness with the product.
