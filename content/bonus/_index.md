### Beyond this workshop

Now that you completed the guided tour, explore beyond this workshop, and try out some advanced concepts.  
Some suggestions:

1. Have you explored the journey metrics yet?
1. Use the API to programmatically add an A/B action to a journey
    * Install and configure the SDK
    * Export a journey that you created earlier, e.g. the **Activate inactive users**
    * Read and modify the exported JSON file
    * Add an A/B action to the journey, with different subject lines to test which one performs better
    * Upload a new version of the journey that includes the A/B test
1. Configure your project to stream events to Amazon S3 for processing
    * What integrations do you need that this is useful for?
    * How do you generate reports for this data?
1. Create a project and use the **Analytics** category in [AWS Amplify](https://aws-amplify.github.io/docs/js/analytics) to send user attributes and events to Amazon Pinpoint
