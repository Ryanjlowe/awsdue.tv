A message template is a set of content and settings that you can create, save, and then reuse in messages that you send for any of your Amazon Pinpoint projects. When you create a template, you specify the content that you want to reuse in various components of messages that are based on the template. These components, referred to as template parts, can contain static text, personalized content, images, and other design elements, depending on the type of template. A template part can also contain channel-specific settings. For example, a template part in a push notification template can specify a custom sound to play or an image to display when a recipient receives a push notification that's based on the template.
