## Journeys

In this section of the workshop we are going to build a journey. In order to do this section you **MUST** complete the previous Pinpoint Getting Started component as we will be using the Segment we  uploaded.

>In Amazon Pinpoint, a journey is a customized, multi-step engagement experience. When you create a journey, you start by choosing a segment that defines which customers will participate in the journey. After that, you add the activities that customers pass through on their journeys. Activities can include sending messages or splitting customers into groups based on their behaviors.
