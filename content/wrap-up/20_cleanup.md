## Cleaning up

Now, that you've completed your first Amazon Pinpoint experience, it is important to do some housekeeping and clean up the resoures that were created for this workshop.


Cleaning up an Amazon Pinpoint project is very straight forward:

1. In the project, use the left bar and navigate to **Settings -> General Settings**

1. Confirm the deletion by typing the **name of your project** into the text field and hitting **OK**
