Amazon Pinpoint enables marketers and developers to deliver customer-centric engagement experiences. Better experiences lead to stronger relationships with your customers and reduce customer churn.

Amazon Pinpoint is an AWS service that you can use to engage with your customers across multiple messaging channels. You can use Amazon Pinpoint to send push notifications, emails, SMS text messages, and voice messages.

Amazon Pinpoint helps you meet your customer engagement goals through features including:

* **Marketing campaigns and journeys** to reach tailored audience segments, for lifecycle management, promotional messages, and onboarding experiences
* **Transactional messages** to specific recipients, to send purchase receipts or deliver one-time passwords
* **Analytics tools** to deepen your understanding of your customers, view trends about your users' level of engagement, purchase and behavioral activity, engagement preferences, and more
* **Generate predictions** about content, channels, and engagement timing to deliver engagements that anticipate your customers’ needs and behaviors

If we were to try and build scalable and highly-available systems to handle each of the above concerns on our own, we’d probably never get around to building our customer relationships. Fortunately, AWS provides services and tools to handle a lot of the undifferentiated heavy lifting involved in building scalable engagement solutions.

You will build on a number of these features in this workshop. If any or all of these features are new to you, don’t worry. We’ll cover everything you need to know to get started. And there’s no better way to learn than to build, so let’s get started!
