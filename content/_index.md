# Amazon Pinpoint Workshop

## Build a multichannel customer engagement solution using Amazon Pinpoint

### Welcome!

In this workshop you will learn how to engage with your customers by using Amazon Pinpoint. You will send email, SMS, push, and voice messages. 
You will leave with an Amazon Pinpoint project that you can use to engage with the right customers at the right time through the right channels.

If any or all of these services are new to you, don’t worry. We’ll cover everything you need to know to get started using everything mentioned above. And there’s no better way to learn than to build, so let’s get started!
