A project in Amazon Pinpoint is a collection of settings, customer information, segments, and campaigns. If you're new to Amazon Pinpoint, your first step is to **create a project**.

### Open the Amazon Pinpoint Console

Head to the [Amazon Pinpoint Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/).

Amazon Pinpoint offers support for multiple regions. Your resources in each region are independent of similar resources in other regions. If you need guidance on regions, visit [Choose your region](../choose-your-region).

### Create an Amazon Pinpoint project

Locate the **Get started** section on the Amazon Pinpoint console. Enter a name for your project. Your project name can contain up to 64 characters. 
Click the **Create a project** button.
